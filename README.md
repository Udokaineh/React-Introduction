List five significant features of React

JSX - React allows you to write HTML-like code using a syntax called JSX, which makes it easy to create and manipulate the components that make up your UI.

Virtual DOM - React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to optimize rendering performance by minimizing updates and re-renders. Instead of updating the entire DOM when changes occur, React compares the virtual DOM to the actual DOM and only updates the parts that have changed.

Performance - React's virtual DOM and efficient rendering algorithm make it a highly performant library for building web applications. It also has tools like React Profiler and React DevTools to help developers optimize performance.

Debugging - React provides a number of tools to help developers debug their applications. The React Developer Tools browser extension, for example, allows you to inspect the components and their state and props in real-time.

Extension - React is highly extensible, which means it can be easily integrated with other libraries and frameworks to build powerful and complex applications. For example, you can use React with Redux to manage your application state or with React Native to build mobile apps.


List five major advantages of React

Reusable components: React's component-based architecture allows developers to create reusable UI components, which can save time and effort in development and help to maintain consistency throughout an application.

Easy to learn: React is relatively easy to learn compared to other web development frameworks, thanks to its simple syntax and well-documented API. This means developers can get up to speed quickly and start building applications faster.

Improved performance: React's use of a virtual DOM and efficient rendering algorithm helps to improve the performance of web applications, resulting in faster load times and smoother user experiences.

Development of both web and mobile apps: React can be used to develop both web and mobile applications, thanks to frameworks like React Native. This allows developers to build cross-platform applications with a single codebase, reducing development time and costs.

Dedicated tools for easy debugging: React comes with a range of dedicated tools and extensions that make debugging and testing applications easier. This includes the React Developer Tools browser extension, which allows developers to inspect and debug React components directly in the browser.
